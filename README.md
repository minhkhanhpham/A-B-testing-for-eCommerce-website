# A-B-testing-for-eCommerce-website
## Problem
The current landing page for our eCommerce website is not converting visitors into customers as effectively as we would like. We believe that a new landing page design could potentially improve our conversion rate.
## Objective
To determine whether a new landing page design can significantly improve the conversion rate compared to the current landing page design.
## Metric 
Conversion rate: The percentage of visitors who making a purchase on our website
## Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no statistically significant difference in conversion rate between the new landing page and the current landing page.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new landing page will lead to a statistically significant increase in conversion rate compared to the current landing page.
## Data Preparing
## Experiment
- Determine sample size
- Z-test
## Conclusion
Based on our A/B test results, we did not observe a statistically significant difference in conversion rates between the control and treatment groups. We can also see that the conversion rate from the new landing page is even less than the old landing page. From those insights, we can conclude that the new landing page is not improving the eCommerce conversion rate.
